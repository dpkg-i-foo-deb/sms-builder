AB  - Context:
Automation is required in the software development to reduce the high costs of producing software and to address the short release cycles of modern development processes. Lot of effort has been performed to automate testing, which is one of the most resource-consuming development phases. Automation of testing through the Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been researched to improve the system testing.
Objective:
We aim to evaluate the complementarity of automated GUI testing tools in a real industrial context, which refers to the capability of the tools to work usefully together.
Methods:
To address the objective, we conduct an exploratory case study in an IT development company from The Netherlands. We select two representative tools for automated GUI testing, one for scripted and another for scriptless testing. We measure the complementarity by measuring the effectiveness, the efficiency, and subjective satisfaction of the tools.
Results:
It can be observed that the scripted tool performs better in detecting process failures, and the scriptless tool performs better in detecting visible failures and also reaching higher coverage. Both tools perform in a similar way in terms of efficiency. Additionally, both tools were perceived to be useful in the survey performed for the subjective satisfaction.
Conclusion:
We conclude that scriptless and scripted testing approaches are complementary, and they can improve the effectiveness compared to manual testing processes performed in an industrial context by detecting different failures and reducing the effort and time to find these failures and to reproduce them.
